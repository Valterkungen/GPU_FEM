# Remote Development Setup

This document provides guidance for setting up remote development environments for CUDA programming.

## SSH Key Setup
1. Generate an SSH key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Add the key to ssh-agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

## Remote Development
For remote GPU development:
- Use SSH for secure connections to GPU servers
- Configure VS Code Remote-SSH extension for seamless development
- Ensure proper CUDA environment setup on remote systems

## Best Practices
- Use key-based authentication for security
- Keep development environments consistent
- Use version control for code synchronization
